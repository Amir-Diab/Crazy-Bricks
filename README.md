# Crazy Bricks (close source)
## About
In contribution with [MAX ART Advertising & Marketing LLC](https://www.maxart.ae/), I have developed the Crazy Bricks game with the graphics designer [Aref Nashawi](https://www.facebook.com/aref.nashawi) for designing the UI elements.

Crazy Bricks is a classic arcade but challenging mobile game that requires precision and attention to pass levels.

## Fulfillment
Crazy Bricks was developed using Unity Game Engine with C#, provided with third-party services (like Google Play Games Services, AdMob, iCloud Save/Load ..).

Store side operations were required as well for publishing and versioning, defining in-app-purchase products and analysing.

## Download
The game is freely available at both Google Play and App Store. Give it a try!
